## Have you ever thought, "Hey.. this mace thing is kind of okay, actually"?
We can all agree that maces are too good and too one off. Even something like the hoe has several, worse variants. This is why this mod aims to add worse maces

## Additions:
- 10 maces

These maces have been carefully crafted to make the mace experience significantly worse and to amplify the amount of annoyance you have with the game 

Here's what they look like:

## Bonus BORING things

It is recommended to use this mod with a recipe mod such as REI in order to view the somewhat complicated crafting recipes in this mod

This mod works in Multiplayer

Do not use this mod if you have anything you care about in a world. Because the maces do have a tendency to do things one would find annoying
